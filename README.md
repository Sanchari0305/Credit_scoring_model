# Credit Scoring Model üìä

A Python-based machine learning project that builds and deploys a credit scoring model to predict whether individuals are likely to default on loans. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and (optionally) a simple UI interface.

## üéØ About

This repository provides a machine learning pipeline to score credit risk. It processes raw financial data (e.g. personal income, credit history, employment), engineers features, and trains a classification model to predict loan default or creditworthiness.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Data cleaning, imputation, and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (e.g. encoding categorical variables, scaling)  
- Train/test split and model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix  
- (Optional) Web interface (Streamlit/Gradio) for live predictions  

---

## üìÅ Dataset

- Input: CSV file (e.g. `credit_data.csv`) containing numerical and categorical features along with a target label indicating default status or credit class  
- Format expected:
  - `age`, `income`, `credit_history`, `employment_length`, `num_of_accounts`, `debt_to_income`, etc.  
  - Target column: `default` or `credit_score` (binary or multiclass)

---

## üß© Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `joblib` (for model persistence)
  - Optional: `streamlit` or `gradio` for UI

Install via:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
# + optional UI:
pip install streamlit gradio
